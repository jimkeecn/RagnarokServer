//To create an NPC in rAthena that interacts with players in the manner you described, you would need to write a script that:

//Prompts the player to input an item ID.
//Checks if the input item is categorized as a costume.
//Checks if the player has more than 5 of a specific item (in this case, item ID 6697).
//Removes 5 of item 6697 from the player's inventory if they have more than 5.
//Adds the input costume item to the player's inventory.
